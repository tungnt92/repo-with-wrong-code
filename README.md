# I. Pre-Commit Hook
## Installation
```
$ brew install pre-commit
```

<code>pre-commit --version</code> should show you what version you're using:
```
$ pre-commit --version
pre-commit 2.11.1
```
## Configure
Copy configuration file <code>.pre-commit-config.yaml</code> at:
```
https://github.com/GumiViet/gumiviet.github.io/blob/master/assets/.pre-commit-config.yaml
```
Put <code>.pre-commit-config.yaml</code> into **root** directory

## Install the git hook scripts
```
$ pre-commit install

pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
```
## Run against all the files (optional)
it's usually a good idea to run the hooks against all of the files when adding new hooks
(usually pre-commit will only run on the changed files during git hooks)

```
$ pre-commit run --all-files
